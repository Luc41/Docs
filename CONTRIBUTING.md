# Contributing to Yarn Spinner

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

## How to send in your contributions

There are many ways you can send your contributions to the Yarn Spinner documentation. You can either **report a bug**, or you can make the changes yourself and **submit a pull request**!

### Reporting bugs and opening issues

Please [report errors in the documetation](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/Docs/issues) and open issues generously. Don't be afraid that your idea is silly, or you're reporting a duplicate. We're happy to hear from you. Seriously.

### Submitting a pull request

The easiest way to contribute to Yarn Spinner's documentation is via a **pull request**.

* [Fork](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/Docs/fork) and clone the repository
* Create a new branch: git checkout -b my-branch-name
* Make your changes
* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/Docs/compare)
* Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

If you're unfamiliar with how pull requests work, [GitHub's documentation on them](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) is very good.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Update the documentation as necessary, as well as making code changes.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* [Write a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

### Branches

The documentation used on [yarnspinner.dev](https://yarnspinner.dev) is driven by the contents of the `master` branch. When this branch is updated, the site is updated shortly afterwards.
